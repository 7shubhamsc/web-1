        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Camping is a form of outdoor recreation or outdoor education involving overnight stays with a basic temporary shelter such as a tent. Camping can also include a recreational vehicle, sheltered cabins, a permanent tent, a shelter such as a bivy or tarp, or no shelter at all. Typically, participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors, in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment or an educational experience.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Camping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. Survivalist and wild campers typically set off with as little as possible to get by. Other campers might use specialized camping gear designed to provide comfort, including their own power and heat sources as well as camping furniture. Camping may be combined with hiking, as in backpacking, and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities [3] such as canoeing, kayaking, climbing, fishing, and hunting. Fastpacking involves both running and camping.There is no universally held definition of what is and what is not camping. .</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-big">Equipment</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The camping tools [15] may vary with by intended activity. For instance, in survival camping the equipment consists of small items which have the purpose of helping the camper in providing food, heat, and safety. The equipment used in this type of camping must be lightweight and it is restricted to the mandatory items. Other types of camping such as winter camping involve having specially designed equipment in terms of tents or clothing that is strong enough to protect the camper's body from the wind and cold.[16] </p>
